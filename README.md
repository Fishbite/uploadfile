# uploadfile

This is a very simple Ajax file uploader using vanilla JS and a simple server-side PHP script.

**Caution**
There is no security of any kind implemented in this i.e.

 - No file type check
 - No file size check - **So be careful!!!**
 - No user log in or password required

As is, the file uploads to  the \upload directory.
